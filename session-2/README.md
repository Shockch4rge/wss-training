This session consists of multiple projects that exercise our capability to create robust web apps with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript (my god). These projects include:

- To-do list
- Formula calculator app
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Inventory System (not game-ish)

With technologies such as:
- HTML
- CSS​
- JavaScript​
- jQuery v3.6.0​
- Node.js v15.14.0​
- Chart.js v3.1.0​
- Popper.js v1.16.1​
- Bootstrap 4.6​
- Zealdocs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4) 

Any assistance consulted for the work done here mainly comes from Zealdocs' offline documentation.
